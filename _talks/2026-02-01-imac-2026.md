Presented findings from the NOMAD internship at Sandia National Labs on simulating shock and tension load cases in Kolsky bar tests for bolted joint coupons. Demonstrated close to 95% accuracy in predicting pre-peak behavior in velocity profiles of the transmitted bar, with experimental validation of shock test simulations.
