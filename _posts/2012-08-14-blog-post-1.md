Working with GE this summer was a full-circle moment for me and not just in the poetic, LinkedIn-approved sense. You're probably thinking, “How full can a circle be?” Well, gather around.

So, picture this: I was born in the U.S. while my dad was working with GE. He was an aerospace engineer on contract with TCS, hustling through engine components and probably praying I wouldn’t end up an artist. He had dropped out of his Ph.D. at IIT Madras and joined TCS (a plot twist worthy of its own Netflix mini-series). Fast forward 25 years, I’m now doing a Ph.D. at Purdue University, holding an undergrad degree from—wait for it—IIT Madras, and I just got to intern at GE’s global headquarters in Schenectady, NY.

I mean… how’s that for character development?

To be honest, the gods must be running a sitcom up there, and I’m just grateful for my recurring role. I was part of GE’s summer internship program, a cozy cohort of around 20 grad students who all somehow knew how to pronounce “Schenectady” on the first try (show-offs). The experience was everything I didn’t know I needed: a refreshing departure from my Ph.D. grind, a chance to apply all the tools I’ve collected over the years to a new, real-world challenge, and zero thesis guilt. A rare treat.

The cherry on top? My team. Super collaborative and incredibly welcoming. I learned a ton, delivered more than I expected, and didn’t even break the coffee machine once. A win by all standards.

Anyone looking to work at GE Aerospace, I would highly recommend that you do!
