I am a final-year PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Purdue University, where my research focuses on developing advanced computational methods to model the progressive damage of polymer matrix composite materials. 
My work builds on the smeared crack approach and explores how manufacturing defects influence structural performance, combining high-fidelity finite element analysis with experimental validation across different length scales.
I work in [Dr. Dianyun Zhang's](https://www.purdue.edu/cmsc/tech-area-bio/zhang.php) lab at the [Composite Manufacturing and Simulation Center (CMSC)](https://www.purdue.edu/cmsc/).

Beyond my core research, I am deeply interested in computational mechanics, failure analysis, multiscale modeling, and materials in general. 
I enjoy bridging theory with practical applications, whether through simulation, data-driven approaches, or experimental mechanics. 
I am also exploring machine learning methods to accelerate predictive modeling of composite behavior.

<!--
Previously, I interned at GE Aerospace Research Center in Niskayuna, where I contributed to applied research in advanced structural analysis using shape memory alloys as actuators for composite panels. 
I also worked in Sandia National Labs as a NOMAD intern on a Bolted Joint Friction Modeling Under Shock Loading project which was far off from my research background which I found very interesting.
I have also taken graduate coursework under leading experts, including Dr. Wenbin Yu, further strengthening my background in elasticity and mechanics of composite materials.

At Purdue, I serve as a teaching assistant for both undergraduate and graduate courses. 
I have assisted in a Strength of Materials lab course, helping students connect theory with hands-on experiments, and in a graduate-level course on the Design and Analysis of Composite Materials, which emphasizes computational modeling using ABAQUS, MATLAB, and related tools.

Looking ahead, I am excited to apply my expertise in structural mechanics, progressive damage modeling, and computational materials science to solve complex engineering challenges in both academia and industry.
