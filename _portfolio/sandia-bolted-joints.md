## Overview

As a **NOMAD intern at Sandia National Labs** (Summer 2025), I worked on modeling the friction behavior of bolted joints under shock loading conditions. I was one of 12 graduate students selected for the highly competitive 8-week NOMAD internship program.

## Key Contributions

- Simulated **shock and tension load cases** in Kolsky bar tests for bolted joint coupons using Sandia's in-house FEM tools
- Developed **Python scripts for automated mesh node tracking** of fiducial points for direct comparison with experimental data
- Achieved close to **95% accuracy** in predicting pre-peak behavior in velocity profiles of the transmitted bar
- Co-authored a conference paper submitted to **IMAC 2026** on shock test simulations and experimental validation

## Technologies

- **Simulation**: Sandia in-house FEM tools, Kolsky bar modeling
- **Programming**: Python (automation, post-processing)
- **Methods**: Shock Loading Analysis, Friction Modeling, Experimental Validation
