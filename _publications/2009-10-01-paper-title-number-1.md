The manufacturing processes of composites involve complex and inter-related procedures that span across multiple physics domains and scales. To understand the effects of the manufacturing processes on a composite laminate we perform a progressive damage analysis on the composite. We aim to compare residual stresses that are developed due to the Cure Hardening Instantaneous Linear Elastic (CHILE) model, and residual stresses developed due to a simple temperature drop from the rubbery state to glassy state during the manufacturing of the composite. On the application of mechanical loading after the curing of the composite, we incorporate the smeared crack approach to account for the progressive damage of the composite.
