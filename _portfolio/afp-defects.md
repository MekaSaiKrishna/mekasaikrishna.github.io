## Overview

This project investigates manufacturing defects inherent to **Automated Fiber Placement (AFP)**, a key technology in aerospace and automotive advanced manufacturing. While AFP enables optimized fiber-steered layups with lower cost through scrap reduction, it introduces unintended imperfections that can compromise structural integrity.

## Key Contributions

- Studied the combined effects of **layup imperfections** (gaps and overlaps) and **consolidation/curing defects** on composite mechanical performance
- Applied the **smeared crack approach** to conduct progressive damage analysis on AFP-fabricated coupons
- Investigated how **optimized cure cycles** can minimize residual stresses during manufacturing
- Presented findings at **SAMPE 2025** in Indianapolis

## Technologies

- **Simulation**: ABAQUS (UMAT), Finite Element Analysis
- **Programming**: FORTRAN, Python
- **Methods**: Progressive Damage Analysis, Cure Cycle Optimization, AFP Process Modeling
