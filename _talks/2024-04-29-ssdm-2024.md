Presented a comprehensive study on the strength characteristics of curved composite laminates, investigating matrix failure and delamination as primary failure modes. Demonstrated a semi-discrete damage model integrating manufacturing effects with experimental validation through 4-point bending tests (ASTM D6415) and DIC imaging for the layup [45/0/-45/90]<sub>3S</sub>.
