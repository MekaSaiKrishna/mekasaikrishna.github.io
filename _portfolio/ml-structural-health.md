## Overview

During my undergraduate research internship at **CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL)** in Bengaluru, India (Summer 2019), I worked on applying machine learning techniques to **Structural Health Monitoring** of aerospace structures.

## Key Contributions

- Used various **ML models to predict loads** acting on a cantilever composite box from strain data measured using FBG (Fibre Bragg Grating) sensors
- Compared **regression models** and **Artificial Neural Network models** using MATLAB's Statistics & Machine Learning toolbox and Neural Network toolbox
- Demonstrated that Neural Network models **decreased computation time by several orders of magnitude** while performing well with anomalous data
- Achieved an absolute error percentage as low as **0.055%** with multivariate linear regression on small datasets

## Technologies

- **Programming**: MATLAB (Statistics & ML Toolbox, Neural Network Toolbox)
- **Methods**: Multivariate Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Structural Health Monitoring
- **Sensors**: Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG)
