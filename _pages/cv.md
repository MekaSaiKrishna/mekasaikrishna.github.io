Work experience
======

### **Graduate Research**: *August 2021 – May 2026*
#### Supervisor: [Dr. Dianyun Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianyun-zhang-30144a62/), Associate Professor, School of Aeronautics & Astronautics, Purdue University ####
  * Derived and developed the incremental formulation for SCA (smeared crack approach) a continuum damage model that can capture different modes of failure such as in-plane failure, out-of-plane failure, and interlaminar failure.
  * Developed and implemented custom UMATs in ABAQUS for progressive damage behavior \& manufacturing of composites.
  * Used the above formulation on microscale RVE generated using random packing algorithm to create large datasets and simulate thermomechanical effects of cure cycle using the CHILE model.
  * Executed 4-point bending experiments of curved L shape laminates validating simulations with the DIC results.
  * Currently working on the optimization of cure cycle to achiever superior strength properties using the above framework.

### **Summer Internship at NOMAD Research Institute**: *June 2025 – August 2025*
#### Supervisor: : [Dr. Adam Bouma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-bouma-a27051126/), [Dr. Christie Crandall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christie-crandall-9b09b1113/), [Dr. Colin Loeffler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-loeffler-63770841/), [Dr. Matt Brake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbrake/), Sandia National Labs (SNL), Albuquerque, New Mexico ####
  * Project: **“Bolted Joint Friction Modeling Under Shock Loading”**
  * One among the 12 graduate students selected for the highly competitive 8-week NOMAD internship program.
  * Simulated shock and tension load cases in Kolsky bar tests for bolted joint coupons using in-house FEM tools of Sandia.
  * Developed Python scripts for automated mesh node tracking of fiducial points for direct comparison with experiments.
  * Were able to predict pre-peak behavior in velocity profiles of transmitted bar with close to 95 % accuracy.
  * Submitted a conference paper to IMAC 2026 with our findings on the shock test simulations and experimental validation.

### **Summer Internship at GE Aerospace**: *June 2024 – August 2024*
#### Supervisor: [Dr. Agniprobho Mazumder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agniprobhomazumder/), GE Aerospace, Niskayuna, New York ####
  * One of the **7** Ph.D. research interns selected for the GE fellow internship 11 week program.
  * Worked on project involving composite part design using shape memory alloys for aerospace structural applications.
  * Developed parametric codes for simulations using ANSYS APDL, optimizing design for expected performance.
  * Created 4 designs that showed different laminate behavior based on the placement of SMA strips used to actuate them.
  * Authored SOPs and documentation for experimental characterization of manufacturing and material behavior of SMAs.

### **Undergraduate Research**: *September 2020 – May 2021*
#### Supervisor: Professor [Dr. K. V. Nagendra Gopal](http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/~gopal/ngopal.html), Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras ####
  * Used semi-analytical method (SSDQM – State Space Differential Quadrature Method) to solve for natural frequencies of primarily laminated sandwich panels with a soft core and later compared it with a finite element 3D model of the same.
  * Coordinated with the advisor and worked entirely remotely due to the pandemic, yet made significant progress while adapting to the situation

### **Summer Undergraduate Research Internship**: *May 2019 – July 2019*
#### Supervisor: [Saransh Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saransh-jain-a604b613/), NAL (CSIR - National Aerospace Laboratories), Bengaluru, India ####
  * Worked in the area of _Structural Health Monitoring_ of Aerospace Structures.
  * Used various Machine learning models to predict loads acting on complicated cantilever composite box by feeding the model strain values to the model measured using FBG (Fibre Bragg Grating) sensors.
  * Compared the results acquired from Regression models and Artificial Neural Network models using MATLAB: Statistics & Machine Learning toolbox and MATLAB: Neural Network toolbox
  * It was observed that use of Neural Network models **decreased** the computation time **by several orders** of magnitude and performs well when anomalous data is provided.
  * For small data sets the absolute error percentage was as low as **0.055 %** multi-variate linear regression model.
