## Overview

During my summer internship at **GE Aerospace Research Center** in Niskayuna, NY (Summer 2024), I worked on an applied research project involving composite part design using **shape memory alloys (SMAs)** for aerospace structural applications. I was one of 7 PhD research interns selected for the GE Fellow Internship program.

## Key Contributions

- Developed **parametric simulation codes** using ANSYS APDL to model and optimize SMA-actuated composite panel designs
- Created **4 distinct designs** demonstrating different laminate behavior based on the strategic placement of SMA strips
- Authored **standard operating procedures (SOPs)** and documentation for experimental characterization of manufacturing and material behavior of SMAs
- Optimized designs for expected performance through iterative simulation

## Technologies

- **Simulation**: ANSYS APDL, ANSYS Workbench
- **Programming**: MATLAB, Python
- **Methods**: Parametric Design, Structural Analysis, Shape Memory Alloy Characterization
