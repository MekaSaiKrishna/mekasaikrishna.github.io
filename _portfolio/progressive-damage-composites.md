## Overview

My primary PhD research focuses on developing and implementing the **smeared crack approach (SCA)**, a continuum damage model for progressive failure analysis of polymer matrix composites. This work captures multiple failure modes including in-plane failure, out-of-plane failure, and interlaminar failure (delamination).

## Key Contributions

- Derived and developed the **incremental formulation for SCA**, enabling accurate simulation of progressive damage under complex loading conditions
- Developed and implemented **custom UMATs in ABAQUS** for progressive damage behavior and manufacturing effects
- Applied the formulation to microscale Representative Volume Elements (RVE) generated using random packing algorithms to simulate **thermomechanical effects of cure cycles** using the CHILE model
- Validated simulations against **4-point bending experiments** of curved L-shaped laminates using DIC (Digital Image Correlation)
- Currently working on **cure cycle optimization** for superior strength properties

## Technologies

- **Simulation**: ABAQUS (User Material Subroutines), ANSYS
- **Programming**: FORTRAN, Python, MATLAB
- **Experimental**: DIC, MTS, 4-point bending (ASTM D6415)
- **Methods**: Finite Element Analysis, Multiscale Modeling, CHILE Model
