Presented research on coupling the effects of curing with progressive damage analysis at the microstructure level using Representative Volume Elements (RVE). Compared residual stresses from the CHILE model against simple temperature-drop models during composite manufacturing, and demonstrated the smeared crack approach for progressive damage under mechanical loading.
